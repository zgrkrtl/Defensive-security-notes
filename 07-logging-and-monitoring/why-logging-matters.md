# Why Logging Matters

Prevention is imperfect. No system is completely secure, controls fail, and attackers adapt. 
Logging provides visibility when prevention fails.

If you cannot see what happened, you cannot respond effectively. Logging turns incidents into analyzable events.

## 1. Detection

Logs allow you to identify suspicious activity such as brute force attempts,
privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

Detection depends on visibility. Without logs, attacks remain unnoticed.


## 2. Investigation

After an incident, these must be answered: When did it start? 
How did it happen? What was affected? Is the attacker still present?

Logs provide the timeline and technical evidence needed for root cause analysis and impact assessment. 
Without logs, investigation becomes guesswork.


## 3. Accountability

Logs record actions taken by users, administrators, and systems. They show who accessed data, 
changed configurations, or modified permissions.

This supports compliance, policy enforcement, and internal accountability.

## 4. Forensics

In serious incidents, logs become digital evidence. They support forensic analysis, legal processes, and regulatory reporting.

Forensics requires accurate timestamps, log integrity, and proper retention. If logs are incomplete or altered, evidence loses reliability.

## 5. Continuous Improvement

Logging is not only reactive. It helps identify weak controls, 
repeated misconfigurations, and gaps in monitoring.

Security improves when visibility improves.
