## The Human Layer

Security is not always technical.

Most breaches are caused of human error.

## 1. Social Engineering

Hackers use exploits of human beings too.

Common levers:
- Authority ("CEO request")
- Urgency ("Immediate action required")
- Fear ("Account will be locked")
- Curiosity ("Confidential document attached")

Technical controls are bypassed through persuasion.

Human trust is often the weakest link.

## 2. Misaligned Incentives

Security failures often result from organizational pressure.

Examples:
- "Ship it now, fix later."
- Delayed patching due to downtime risk.
- Over-permissioned accounts for convenience.
- Ignoring audit warnings to meet deadlines.


## 3. Convenience Bias

Users prefer:
- Reused passwords
- Disabled MFA
- Shared accounts
- Minimal restrictions

When security creates friction,
users look for shortcuts.

Security design must account for human behavior.


## 4. Overconfidence Bias

Developers and administrators often assume:
- "No one will target us."
- "Our system is too small."
- "We are not interesting."

## 5. Security Communication

Excessive alerts, warnings, and policies
can cause users to ignore real threats.

If everything is urgent,
nothing is urgent.

Security communication must be clear and meaningful.
