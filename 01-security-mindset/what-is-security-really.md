## What is not security?

Security doesn't mean %100 assurance.

## What is security?

Security means managing risk to an acceptable level
given limited time, money and complexity.

**CIA triad**

- Confidentiality - Only real authorized personal can access  the data
- Integrity - Data cannot be altered without authorization or with fake authorization
- Availability - Systems should be usable at any time needed

There is a tradeoff between those three principles.

**Risk vs Threat vs Vulnerability**

- Threat - Something that has a potential to cause harm
- Vulnerability - A weakness that can be exploited.
- Risk - Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability multiplied by impact.

Security is about reducing risk, not eliminating threats.

**Security vs Compliance**

- Compliance - Following rules, standarts, regulations or policies.
- Security - Actually showing resistance to attacks.

It is possible to be fully compliant and still vulnareable to attacks.
Compliance is static, documentation-driven on the other hand security is dynamic, adversarial, continuous

**Attacker vs Defender Asymmetry**

Attackers only need to find one weakness.

Defenders must protect everything.

This asymmetry makes security inherently difficult.

Security is not about building an unbreakable system.
It is about building resilient systems.
