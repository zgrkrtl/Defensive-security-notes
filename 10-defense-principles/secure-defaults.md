# Secure Defaults

Systems should be secure out of the box.

Users should not need deep security knowledge to be safe.

## 1. What Secure Defaults Mean

- Features disabled by default
- Least privilege by default
- Logging enabled
- Strong configurations

## 2. Why Defaults Matter

Most users:
- Don’t read documentation
- Don’t change configs
- Don’t understand risk

Insecure defaults scale insecurity.

Security should fail toward safety, not convenience.
