# Assume Breach

Assume attackers will eventually get in.

Design systems with this assumption.

## 1. Why Assume Breach

- Perfect security does not exist
- Credentials leak
- People make mistakes

Planning for failure improves resilience.

## 2. Design Implications

- Strong monitoring
- Rapid detection
- Limited privileges
- Segmentation
- Incident response readiness

Assume breach turns security from prevention-only into resilience engineering.
