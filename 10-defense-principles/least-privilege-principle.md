# Least Privilege Principle

Least privilege means giving only the minimum access required. Not more and not less.

## 1. Minimal Access Philosophy

Users, services, and applications should:
- Access only what they need
- Only for the time needed
- Only at the scope needed

Excess permissions are risk.

## 2. Common Violations

- Services running as root
- Broad IAM roles
- Shared admin accounts
- Long-lived credentials

Convenience often overrides security.

## 3. Least Privilege Principle Value

When an account is compromised:
- Damage is limited
- Lateral movement is harder
- Detection is easier

Least privilege turns breaches into incidents, not whole security failures.
