# Segmentation and Isolation

Segmentation limits how far an attacker can move.

Isolation limits what compromised components can access.

## 1. Network Segmentation Logic

Divide networks into zones:
- Public
- Internal
- Sensitive
- Management

Traffic between zones is controlled and monitored.

## 2. Application Isolation

- Separate services
- Containerization
- Sandboxing
- Separate databases per service

Compromise should not spread freely.

## 3. Lateral Movement Prevention

Attackers move laterally after initial access.

Segmentation:
- Breaks attack paths
- Limits blast radius
- Forces re-exploitation

Flat networks are attacker-friendly.
