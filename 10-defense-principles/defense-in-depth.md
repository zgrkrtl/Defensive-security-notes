# Defense in Depth

Defense in depth means using multiple layers of security controls.

No single control is trusted to fully protect a system.

## 1. Layering Concept

Examples of layers:
- Network firewalls
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Input validation
- Logging and monitoring
- Incident response

If one layer fails,
others still slow or stop the attacker.

## 2. Why Single Controls Fail

- Software has bugs
- Configurations drift
- Credentials leak
- Zero-days exist
- People can make mistakes

Relying on one control creates a single point of failure.

## 3. Delay, Detect, Contain

Defense in depth is not only about prevention.

It aims to:
- Delay attackers
- Detect abnormal behavior
- Contain damage

Time works for the defender if detection exists.
